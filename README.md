## breasy - the fast way of browsing

breasy is a simple and fast browser in the tradition of 
[lariza](http://github.com/okraits/lariza).

Written with the Qt5 toolkit, it is based on QWebView (webkit2) right now,
but it will eventually move to QWebEngineView (Chromium).

### Features (currently implemented)

- fast startup and browsing, light on system resources
- slim userinterface with tabs
- opens a given number of URLs provided as commandline arguments on startup
- keybindings similar to Firefox
- search the current page
- content zoom

For upcoming features, take a look at the todo list further down this page and stay tuned.

### Why another browser?

Most mainstream browsers (firefox, chrome) are kind of slow and heavy on
system resources. And i don't need all the features of alternative browsers
like dwb, uzbl, qutebrowser etc.

I was quite happy with vain's [lariza](http://github.com/vain/lariza) so i
[forked](http://github.com/okraits/lariza) it to add the features i needed.
But lately webkit(2)gtk seems to have quite some issues so i decided to switch
to Qt and use Qt Webkit for my own browser.
