## breasy - the fast way of browsing

This will be a simple and fast browser someday in the tradition of 
[lariza](http://github.com/okraits/lariza).

Written with the Qt5 toolkit, it is based on QWebView (webkit) right now,
but it will eventually move to QWebEngineView (Chromium).

Stay tuned for features and improvements.
